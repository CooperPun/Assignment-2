      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Autonomous vehicles</h1>
      <p>Self-Driving cars have been dreamt about for decades by science fiction fanatics and scientists all over the world. 
	  We are in an age in time where technology has surpassed the human ability in most activities, and this has been implemented into driving and Automobiles. 
	  Self-Driving cars have been at the forefront of the Automobile and Technology worlds for the last decade and companies such as Samsung, Tesla, Mercedes, Audi, Nissan, Uber and even Google (among many others) have set out to develop and release commercially viable self-driving vehicles within the very near future.</p>
	  <p>What does it do?</p>
	  <p>In a nutshell, autonomous cars currently have the ability to drive from point A to point B on the roads with no driver present; or if there is one present, not in control of the vehicle. 
	  The cars utilise specific technology that allow it to recognise and build a virtual image of the surroundings to allow it to drive the car like a human would. 
	  The specific technologies that the Autonomous cars use are Lidars (light detection and ranging), Cameras, Sensors, GPS, and Inertial navigation systems. 
	  A Lidar (light detection and ranging) is a device normally atop the cars, that spins and fires out millions of lasers every second to measure how long they take to come back. 
	  This allows the car to construct a 3-D map of its surroundings and helps the car understand where it is and what surrounds it. 
	  Similarly, Cameras and Sensors are used to detect other things on the road, such as road lines, speed signs, traffic lights etc, allowing the car to obey the road rules effectively. 
	  The car also uses Machine Learning (AI) to understand driving norms and other things often on road, such as cyclists. 
	  The computers get shown millions of examples so when it comes to making a decision the car can identify and make a decision based off its knowledge. 
	  This also means the Car continuously learns from it’s experiences so it has a better understanding of how to navigate the roads on it’s own.
	  As of right now, Autonomous cars are being driven on our roads as a part of extensive tests and experiments to analyse the real-world application and impact of self-driving cars. 
	  Mercedes recently announced that an ‘S-class sedan completed a 62-mile journey in the streets of Germany without a driver’. 
	  Uber is perhaps the most interesting in its application of Autonomous vehicles, testing self-driving cars in 4 cities across the US and Canada (Pittsburgh, Tempe, San Francisco, and Toronto). 
	  Uber was successfully operating their self-driving cars in these 4 cities until a self-driving uber crashed and killed a Woman in Tempe, Arizona. 
	  Uber has now suspended it’s testing to further investigate the fatality and fix the issue that caused it. 
	  These cars are currently programmed with “relative negative consequence of impact” technology which, when in an accident situation, will choose the “least bad” option. 
	  Hypothetically, if a dog runs in front of the car, but swerving away would mean hitting a child in a pram, the autonomous car can distinguish life forms and avoid hitting the child. 
	  This type of technology still potentially has its flaws, but it’s decision making is far superior to that of a human as it assesses the situation, decides on the ‘least bad’ outcome and executes its decisions faster and more accurately than a human could. 
	  This seems to be the only problem with the cars ability to drive on the roads, and compared to human driving, doesn’t pose as much of a threat to other people; because humans make more errors due to many different things, such as being tired, losing concentration or just simply making an error.
	  Over the next few years, we can expect to see the implementation of driverless cars on our roads from companies such as Samsung; who have partnered with Rinspeed to develop a self-driving car, that is designed for level-5 (fully autonomous) driving, that can be on the roads by 2025. 
	  Nvidia, who have partnered with Uber and Volkswagen, confirmed that Uber has been using their GPU computing technology in their self-driving cars. 
	  And more recently, Volkswagen signed a deal with Uber to work together to develop self-driving cars, in conjunction with Nvidia. 
	  Nvidia is a worldwide chipmaker, and they have harnessed their technology and used it to develop the technology for Uber’s and Volkswagen’s self-driving cars. 
	  Furthermore, Volkswagen has also partnered with a Silicon Valley start up called ‘Aurora’ to get self-driving taxis on the roads in various cities by 2021, and to also launch dozens of test vehicles this year (2018). 
	  So, throughout the next six to seven years from now their will be self-driving cars in all aspects of motor transportation, all across the world.</p>
	  <p>What is the likely impact?</p>
	  <p>Self-driving cars will shape and change many different parts of todays society. 
	  For starters, in today’s age 90% of millions of road fatalities are caused by human error. 
	  This number is to be drastically reduced when autonomous cars are released and used on roads. 
	  The use of the ‘Relative negative consequence of impact’ technology will eliminate human error from vehicle collisions and accidents and reduce the number of fatalities caused by vehicle collisions. 
	  The biggest change that society will undergo, is plainly the shift from humans driving cars to them not driving. 
	  People might not feel in control and therefore not trust the autonomous car’s ability to drive. 
	  People also do enjoy driving, so there are problems that can rise from people that want to continue driving but aren’t able to. 
	  The people most likely to be affected would be people that rely on driving to earn their wages and their living. 
	  This includes taxi drivers, delivery drivers truck drivers etc. As of November 2017, refrigerators were being driven in trucks from El Paso, Texas all the way to a distribution centre in Palm Springs, California. 
	  This implementation of self-driving trucks can make current drivers obsolete and out of the job. Some technologies may become redundant, like the steering wheel and other technologies that are used for human input driving. 
	  In the Rinspeed SNAP, designed by Samsung and Rinspeed, there is no steering wheel in the car, because there is no need or use for it as the car internally moves and controls the wheels alignment and doesn’t need human input to change it.</p>
	  <p>How will this affect you?</p>
	  <p>In my day-to-day life, I use motor transport constantly, whether it be personal motor transport, public transport or services such as Uber. 
	  If all these changes to the transportation industry are implemented, I can see my means of transportation being altered but not different in a lot of ways. 
	  I will no longer need to be driven or drive myself anywhere, however I will still be driven in a car from point A to point B, this will not change. 
	  Personally, I trust an autonomous vehicle more than I do a human driver, but this will only be the case if there are no other human drivers on the roads. 
	  Therefore, I can fully trust that no human error can occur when being transported. 
	  Catching Uber’s will be drastically different, and I believe it will change the direction of the business completely. 
	  My friends and families are car enthusiasts, so seeing the changes in the transportation industry to autonomous vehicles may upset a large majority of the population, as they no longer have the freedom to drive themselves; 
	  which I know that a lot of my friends and family enjoy doing.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Cybersecurity</h1>
	  <p>What does it do?</p>
      <p>Over the last century, modern technology has rapidly advanced where computers have stably established itself as a revolutionary product. 
	  It has become so common that every household as well as businesses all regard it as an essential item. 
	  However, with the great benefits of computers and the advancement of internet which has brought great convenience, it has also opened up vulnerabilities where it has been exploited by threats and unauthorised hackers who have made information and storage susceptible to a range of cyber-attacks. 
	  Hence, computer experts have effectively worked on ways to combat and alleviate these problems so that confidentiality are maintained, and privacy is assured to all those people involved. 
	  Cyber security has become a critical part of modern technology today and as greater threats begin to emerge through higher tech skills and knowledge, there will be a high demand for more security specialists that are able to fight against it.
	  Cyber Security in general definitions is the protective measures taken to secure sensitive and confidential information from criminal hackers that are motivated to steal, manipulate and destroy important data.  
	  There are a variety of different cyber security threats exercised and practiced in act to infiltrate data such as ransomware, malware, social engineering and phishing. 
	  Firstly, the act of ransomware is the installation of a harmful program that similarly replicate a real-life ransom but on a technological platform. 
	  When activated it prevents the targeted user from being able to access data and storage until a certain amount of ransom is paid which also is not guaranteed in any regards.  
	  Secondly, Malware is any software created with the intent to harm the device that runs the program and thirdly, social engineering is a trickery tactic that we are exposed constantly when accessing certain websites. 
	  It can ultimately be designed to deceive users in entering confidential details or even payment related bank information that are stolen and given to unauthorised hackers running the program. 
	  Lastly, Phishing is a scam strategy that typically involve sending emails that replicate a reliable email to specified targets. 
	  However, when users open the email they are directed to enter confidential information such as bank details or passwords which are completely handed over to hackers for exploitation.  
	  The concept of cyber security is essentially an implementation of a range of techniques to prevent future potential attacks and effectively setting up layers of protection to defend against a variety of threats employed by hackers. 
	  It can involve constant monitoring and analysis of threats and risks to set up appropriate security framework and architecture such as a firewall.
	  In the near future we can expect to see an implementation of both artificial intelligence and machine learning in our current technologies which will substantially benefit and aid the security operations needed to protect our data. 
	  Currently, with today’s cyber security conventions it can be easy to lets bugs and malware go undetected and ultimately affect our system with viruses and theft of valuable information. 
	  However, with AI and machine learning functions this will prove to become much more of an efficient process in detecting errors and combating the different types of threats in a timely and less labour-intensive manner.</p>
	  <p>What is the likely impact?</p>
	  <p>Essentially, what artificial intelligence can do to enhance our current level of cyber security skills is that it will be able to automate complex processes so that detection and responses are accelerated and extremely precise.  
	  However, the development of artificial intelligence will not always be positive but potentially pose to be a loophole, as criminals are also able to get in reach and exploit it. 
	  If criminals are able to create software that are able to do machine learning, it will mean that malicious software will be analyse and learn for themselves about how to avoid and access highly confidential information protected by companies and organizations.
	  Large businesses and firms are being targeted by cyber criminals and is evident that organisations are having no option but to advance their security system and implement new tactics to defend against cyber terrors. 
	  Hence, in the future we can expect to see a rapid transition of artificial intelligence beginning to mix into our modern technology and subsequently, cyber security itself will be greatly benefited from such innovations. 
	  The concept of machine learning, allowing machines to teach themselves and form algorithms as well as patterns to recognise different types of cyber-attacks and threats will ultimately lessen the pressure on humans to be fully responsible with whatsoever damage intended by unauthorised users.  
	  Furthermore, with artificial intelligence coming into our technology they will be responsible for much of the activities humans have done through hands-on labour. 
	  Machines in comparison to humans are programmed to accomplish and progressively do things in a much quicker and efficient way, which have instilled fear in people’s mind that their job will be taken over.  
	  Fortunately, however with the rise of such technology it is speculated that it will not necessarily get rid of jobs for humans in the cyber security workforce but instead change the type of work and duties humans will have to carry out.</p>
	  <p>How will this affect you?</p>
	  <p>In our daily life, we are constantly exposed to cyber threats and harms that can potentially have huge impacts when targeted or affected by it. 
	  This includes our email and social network accounts, payment systems and personal information. 
	  Nowadays cyber criminals are very intelligent and knowledgeable with their attacks and once they can incorporate artificial intelligence and manipulate it to their needs, their cyber-attacks will prove to be much more potent and powerful threat that may distort our privacy system and sensitive information we hold. 
	  However, the applications and programs we use will continue to advance in their security system and improve the security sections which will make it equally more difficult for criminals to infiltrate. 
	  Nevertheless, we must always be educated and have the fundamental understanding of staying safe and secured in the online world.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Robots</h1>
	  <p>What does it do?</p>
      <p>The definition to a robot is a machine, especially one programmable by a computer, capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. 
	  Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within but majority of robots developed are programmed to be independent. 
	  Robots are designed to help out humans in daily lives or even complete tasks that humans are incapable of doing without exposing in danger. 
	  In current stage of robots, there are commercially produced robots to help to entertain children and casual cleaning of floors in houses. 
	  For industrial robots, they are widely use in mass manufacturing, packaging, assembly and transport since using robots to perform these tasks are much more efficient compare to humans. 
	  Robots can also be a substitution of humans to perform extremely dangerous tasks to humans but these types of robots are externally controlled by humans to carry out tasks such as examining suspicious packages, search surrounding areas to find even deactivate improvised explosive devices and mines and deliver unexploded ordinance for examination or proper detonation. 
	  But the use of robots is more extend than that, they are capable of underwater exploration, cleaning oil spills, investigating hazardous environments, or even deep space exploration. 
	  As for automatic and independent robots, ASIMO and Sophia are the examples of most advanced robots, for this type of robots, they need to be advance in both mechanics and AI. 
	  ASIMO focused on the full body mechanics with an advance AI to control its motions. 
	  ASIMO is capable to recognise moving objects, postures and gestures which allows it to make simple physical interaction with users such as handshaking when offered. 
	  ASIMO is built with multiple sensors such as visual sensors, laser sensors, infrared sensors and ultrasonic sensors which allows ASIMO to navigate through the environment autonomously without tripping over obstacles since it can detect obstacles using the 2 visual sensors. 
	  The factor that made ASIMO as such an advance robot is that ASIMO is able to balance on one leg and the detailed movements of the fingers. 
	  ASIMO is able to hop on only one leg thanks to his balance control system which also allowing it to shoot penalty shots with a soccer ball. 
	  As for the fingers, its precise and detailed movement allows it to open bottle caps and pour drinks into a cup. 
	  Whilst ASIMO is able to physically interacts with users, Sophia focuses on human interactions via facial expressions and engage in conversations. 
	  Sophia is able to respond to questions using pre-written responses but Sophia can also share the information via cloud network and analyse the inputs with blockchain technology which she is able to get smarter over time. 
	  With the computer algorithms built in Sophia, she is able to sustain eye contact and recognise individuals. With the facial recognition software, Sophia is able to follow faces and ultimately allow her to make expressions just like how humans do. 
	  In the future, with the combination between different advanced robots now, more advanced robots can be created to make conversations and motions just like a natural human. 
	  In combination of biology, neurology and such, more advanced and smarter prosthetics limbs can be made to act the same as normal human limbs. 
	  In combination of Nano-technology, nanobots can be used to eliminate bacteria and viruses, nanobots can also use to reduce the chance of other diseases cause by cholesterol or other factors.</p>
	  <p>What is the likely impact?</p>
	  <p>Impact from this type of technology is tremendous since it can be used in many other areas. 
	  As for military, replacement of soldiers with robots can reduce casualties which lowers amount of lives costed in conflicts. 
	  In industries, robots can replace human workers which will be much more efficient and decreases the chance of human errors made to the products. 
	  For medical use, robots can be used in preventing diseases with nanobots, or elderly care and nursing with general use robots. 
	  Police can use the robots in many different ways such as traffic control and pursuing criminals. 
	  Robots can also be used in firefighting services, depending in what types of tools is equipped on the robots, they are able to fight fire, rescue people and so on. 
	  Once robots are widely used, all humanity will be affected because robots can be used in almost every situation. For infants or children, childcare and companion robots will take over from babysitters; 
	  For elderly, nursing robots can manage and help their everyday lives; General use robots can also be seen in domestic houses to do chores or even for home security. 
	  When the robotic technologies start to influence the job market, it will make redundant of many jobs or even technologies due to how widely robots can be used for, such as carpenters, soldiers, nurses, babysitters, builders and factory workers of many kinds. 
	  But there will be a mass increase in the fields of IT, such as AI developers and robotics designers.</p>
	  <p>How will this affect you?</p>
	  <p>As for now, there are variety of jobs on demand but in the future when robotics can substitute all kinds of work, many people will lose their jobs since using robotics is much more time efficient and also cost efficient, therefore people will be forced to study IT or mechanics. 
	  But in terms of daily life, it will be much more efficient and convenient with the use of robotics. 
	  People might not need to know how to cook anymore when there are robots which produces all types of cuisine; 
	  drivers replaced with robotics or self-driving cars; no more chores to do because robotics will take over. 
	  As many tasks can be taken over by robotics, people with sensory impairment movement impairments or any disabilities can live normally and efficiently just like normal. 
	  When family members became elderlies and have no time to take care of them since people need to work, they will often have robots to take care of them.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Clouds, Services, Servers</h1>
	  <p>What does it do?</p>
      <p>We use cloud computing without even realising it. 
	  A simple online service that can send emails, watch TV or listen to music are all examples of cloud computing. 
	  The cloud is the first sense of cloud services which cover a wide range of resources that a service provider delivers to customers via the internet. 
	  These cloud services by customers can be provisioned on an on-demand basis and shut down when the user does not need it anymore. 
	  Cloud computing allows for Software as a Service (SaaS) which is delivered in a pay-per-use basis. 
	  Clouds are only able to exist via a server, which is a computer program or device providing use for other programs or devices, which are regarded as ‘clients’. 
	  The main benefits of cloud computing are that it eliminates that expense of needing to buy hardware and software, forming the racks of servers, the need of IT experts managing the infrastructure. 
	  They can also be made for a global scale, and provide very fast services, whilst still providing the productivity the user wants. 
	  With this the cloud can constantly produce data backups which a regular users hard drive would not imagine, but with this has disaster recover methods as data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites that are on the cloud providers network. 
	  In the future the need for physical hard drives may almost just not be needed as cloud services can become so extravagant. 
	  Cloud vendors may have solved the compute hardware problem, and then we can expect infrastructure to become a commodity. 
	  The future essentially will be easy access and consumption of any data and services in the cloud. 
	  AI can be implemented making these services easily consumable and highly available to users, hence only requiring developers to produce the cloud. 
	  Companies could simply buy a monitor, keyboard and a client that controls these 3 things as a workstation, and then all the desktop appearance, applications and functionality of a computer would be handled by a third party cloud service.</p>
	  <p>Various cloud-based services are offered which include,</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>web based cloud computing which are companies that use the functionality by web services so they do not have to develop a full application</li>
		<li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) which is when organisations make use of unlimited storage that is available from the cloud infrastructure, so they do not need to worry about having physical dedicated servers in their vicinity</li>
		<li>Software as a Service (SaaS) which allows users to access software without worrying about storage and other issues arising</li>
		<li>Platform as a Service (PaaS) allowing companies to run applications on the cloud service without the need of having it installed on their physical hard drives or on their own servers. Companies requiring the storage of a lot of data therefore can store their data in a remote location or even have the capability of forming a virtual data centre</li>
		<li>Utility services for companies wanting to store a lot of data without the hassle of their own servers and create a virtual data centre</li>
		<li>Managed Services which are applications used by people that provide the cloud service, giving the possibility of preventing spam services</li>
		<li>Service Commerce that is the creation of a hub of applications an organisation can use providing the application and services they want to use alongside it</li>
		</ul>
	  <p>What is the likely impact?</p>
	  <p>Socially clouds, services and servers have changed how we interact with others, as we can now watch a performance, such as our favourite artist recently that had performed at Coachella on YouTube, without us needing to travel all the way their and buy tickets. 
	  Cloud computing enables us to connect with friends via an application such as Facebook without the need of producing a hand-written letter which is then sent by mail. 
	  Public figures and politicians are able to tune into twitter to view how their community is and convey their own views knowing that they have a lot of influence on others. 
	  Cloud technology also offers benefits to developing countries as they do not need to invest into their own physical servers, but rather they can just pay a small fee to a cloud service that can minimise the price drastically. 
	  Education institutions have realised that cloud technology can be used for students to access data anywhere, anytime, and even enrol into classes online or participate in group activities. 
	  This allows parents to view their children’s reports or access their school bills and pay online, without the need of visiting the school and physically handing over the cash with the handwritten and signed statements. 
	  Cloud technology can also be used for the healthcare industry, for example managing non-siloed patient data and being able to share it among other medical professionals, or patients so they can check their health status and treatment follow-ups. 
	  Access to this data through devices such as mobile phones would provide a quick solution whilst keeping a secure environment that still follows the regulations they must be under. 
	  In the coming years the healthcare industry will boom with this technology.</p>
	  <p>How will this affect you?</p>
	  <p>Cloud technology has already taken over almost everyone’s lives. 
	  Whilst I am making this assignment, Microsoft automatically saves my work, which then saves onto OneDrive which is Microsoft’s private cloud service they provide for each registered user. 
	  As I do this assignment I get messages from my group members regarding work that has been done or work they have done that they want use to look over via google docs, another cloud technology which basically implements an online version of Microsoft word, which anyone invited to can edit, which then automatically saves to the google drive. 
	  As I am working on this assignment I am also listening to music via Spotify, which is a cloud of music which when I want to play a selected song, it will be streamed to me hence resulting in some good tunes. 
	  RMIT canvas itself is one giant cloud server, as I can go to any subject, and the download specific materials that I want, which has been stored on the canvas. 
	  This has been secured so that only users with proper logins can access their assigned subjects and resources. 
	  As I work on this assignment I also tend to be distracted and view discord, which on the servers my friends have created on their platform store all files and messages posted since the beginning of it. 
	  When it comes to the affects on my family, we do not need to use a USB when we want to transfer images from our phones, as we can simply go onto the messenger app at ease and then send it. 
	  We all enjoy Netflix, which all accounts can be accessed on all our devices around the house, so we do not need to share the same account, but still not need to pay for 4 separate people.</p>
