      <p>My ideal job is to become a games developer. 
	  A job in games development is appealing to me because of the opportunity to create and implement my own ideas into existing or new projects.</p>

      <p>Having looked at the burning glass data my ideal job of working in the computer security field has not changed. 
	  Despite my idea job being not mentioned on the IT list, I strongly believe that as technologies continue to develop there will be greater and more frequent threat hence smarter and effective measures will need to be prepared and implemented to combat attacks from unauthorised attackers.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Robots</h1>
      <p>The definition to a robot is a machine, especially one programmable by a computer, capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. 
	  Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within but majority of robots developed are programmed to be independent. 
	  Robots are designed to help out humans in daily lives or even complete tasks that humans are incapable of doing without exposing in danger. 
	  In current stage of robots, there are commercially produced robots to help to entertain children and casual cleaning of floors in houses. 
	  For industrial robots, they are widely use in mass manufacturing, packaging, assembly and transport since using robots to perform these tasks are much more efficient compare to humans. 
	  Robots can also be a substitution of humans to perform extremely dangerous tasks to humans but these types of robots are externally controlled by humans to carry out tasks such as examining suspicious packages, search surrounding areas to find even deactivate improvised explosive devices and mines and deliver unexploded ordinance for examination or proper detonation. 
	  But the use of robots is more extend than that, they are capable of underwater exploration, cleaning oil spills, investigating hazardous environments, or even deep space exploration. 
	  As for automatic and independent robots, ASIMO and Sophia are the examples of most advanced robots, for this type of robots, they need to be advance in both mechanics and AI. 
	  ASIMO focused on the full body mechanics with an advance AI to control its motions. 
	  ASIMO is capable to recognise moving objects, postures and gestures which allows it to make simple physical interaction with users such as handshaking when offered. 
	  ASIMO is built with multiple sensors such as visual sensors, laser sensors, infrared sensors and ultrasonic sensors which allows ASIMO to navigate through the environment autonomously without tripping over obstacles since it can detect obstacles using the 2 visual sensors. 
	  The factor that made ASIMO as such an advance robot is that ASIMO is able to balance on one leg and the detailed movements of the fingers. 
	  ASIMO is able to hop on only one leg thanks to his balance control system which also allowing it to shoot penalty shots with a soccer ball. 
	  As for the fingers, its precise and detailed movement allows it to open bottle caps and pour drinks into a cup. 
	  Whilst ASIMO is able to physically interacts with users, Sophia focuses on human interactions via facial expressions and engage in conversations. 
	  Sophia is able to respond to questions using pre-written responses but Sophia can also share the information via cloud network and analyse the inputs with blockchain technology which she is able to get smarter over time. 
	  With the computer algorithms built in Sophia, she is able to sustain eye contact and recognise individuals. With the facial recognition software, Sophia is able to follow faces and ultimately allow her to make expressions just like how humans do. 
	  In the future, with the combination between different advanced robots now, more advanced robots can be created to make conversations and motions just like a natural human. 
	  In combination of biology, neurology and such, more advanced and smarter prosthetics limbs can be made to act the same as normal human limbs. 
	  In combination of Nano-technology, nanobots can be used to eliminate bacteria and viruses, nanobots can also use to reduce the chance of other diseases cause by cholesterol or other factors.</p>
