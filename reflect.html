      <p>This group was extremely effective in getting this assignment done and to a high standard. 
	  Throughout the group, we all have our own unique characteristics that are stated in the Team Profile, and we all utilised them and communicated very well to ensure that everything had been completed. 
	  Everyone put effort into the assignment which can definitely be seen by the final product that was produced, everyone completed the work that was assigned to them and did everything they could to help one another our to get all the work done. 
	  Our groups strength was our communication, we would always bounce ideas off each-other and make sure everyone was on task. 
	  It was good to have a reliable group that would always message or let the rest of the group what was going on. 
	  Something that our group can improve on would be our time management skills. 
	  Despite this, none of our work was rushed or completed last minute, we just took our time completing our work to a high standard. 
	  What was surprising to the group was the initiative everyone had toward the assignment, with communication being prominent, we could all ask questions if we had them, then get right back into our work. 
	  What was also surprising was the standard to which the group completed their work, it was reassuring to see the work the group was doing was thorough and well produced. 
	  What we have learnt whilst working in a group, is that a task doesn’t seem that daunting or difficult if the group constantly splits the workload and supports each-other. 
	  What the group has seemed to pick up and learn is the importance of communication when it comes to a collaborative assignment. 
	  Being able to ask questions at any time and clarify things with anyone in the group is something that the group has understood as a valuable part of group work. 
	  The GitHub log simply reflects the groups ability to use GitHub, as many of us didn’t understand the many features that GitHub has, Cooper still utilised to to share the website us which was very helpful. 
	  The group mainly used a Google Docs to share the work that each member did, the ability to see the work done by other members was extremely useful for the creation of the website as the content can be copied and pasted from the Docs straight into the code.</p>
