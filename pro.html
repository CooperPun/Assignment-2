      <p>Karl, an indie games developer, solely works on a project called 'Equilinox'; a game that he is creating and developing. 
	  Karl uploads weekly videos going through what he does each day of the week in regards to his game, how it is going, the work that he is doing and the problems he is facing. 
	  Karl has a very efficient method of completing tasks, whereby he has a list of about 8-10 goals that he wants to accomplish in regards to his game and then plans his day around completing, or making significant progress in those goals; 
	  keep in mind the goals are very broad, but the daily plans are more specific. 
	  These tasks are mainly adding in small changes and items in the game, fixing movement mechanics, and most importantly fixing bugs in the game. 
	  Karl says, "as one bug gets fixed another pops up", however he always fixes the issue eventually. 
	  Karl codes the game in Java, which he seems to be very proficient in. 
	  Other work he does includes creating new models for animals and plants in his game, adding sounds in for various animals, fixing and improving the home screens and designing his website (which he has a developer for) and his Steam page.</p>
	  <p>Karl develops and creates this game, seemingly, by himself. 
	  He does everything to do with the game by himself, but does interact with a few groups of people in regards to other aspects of his game. 
	  Firstly, he has a developer that works on his website about his game. 
	  He has only mentioned this once but it seems this developer has developed a website in collaboration with Karl for his game. 
	  Secondly, he contacts the company Steam about the page for his game. 
	  Steam is a digital distribution platform that acts as a store or marketplace for people to release their own games. 
	  So Karl interacts with them to get the page for his game made and running. 
	  Lastly, Karl interacts with his YouTube audience the most. Karl uploads weekly and always asks for suggestions on what to improve and what to change. 
	  For example he has left it up to his audience to decide the logo for Equilinox, out of 4 different designs. 
	  He constantly bounces ideas of his audience for suggestions and actively responds in the comments to helpful feedback left by his viewers.</p>
	  <p>Karl spends most of his working time in at a desk in his apartment. 
	  He works on his game for most of his day at his desk. 
	  He often films his outings to the park or other places, to give his videos some other content besides his work. 
	  But most of his time is spent working at his desk.</p>
	  <p>The most challenging aspect of his work would have to be the bugs in his game. 
	  He repeatedly says how many glitches and bugs he comes across unknowingly which take him a good amount of time to fix and get working. 
	  And as previously stated, once a bug gets fixed another one seems to appear which just prolongs the time spent fixing bugs.</p>

      <p>Having looked at the burning glass data my ideal job of working in the computer security field has not changed. 
	  Despite my idea job being not mentioned on the IT list, I strongly believe that as technologies continue to develop there will be greater and more frequent threat hence smarter and effective measures will need to be prepared and implemented to combat attacks from unauthorised attackers.</p>
