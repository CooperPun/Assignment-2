      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Project Idea</h1>
      <p>Our group project idea is a FPS (First Person Shooter) mode game that specifically revolves around a realistically animated tank. 
	  The tank will take the form as a futuristic, car-sized levitating tank which it will be able to fly since it has jet engines at the bottom of the model and these engines will play the sound of the jet engines as the tank is airborne since the sound source will be link onto the jet engines of the model and activates as the y-axis is change by user inputs. 
	  The sound effect for the tank engine will be playing at all time until the tank disappeared from the map as the player’s hit point drop to zero and the sound will start playing again as the player spawns back onto the map. 
	  The sound source for the cannon will be placed at the muzzle of the cannon as it fires. When the tank is shot by others, the sound source in the middle of the tank will activate as soon as the bullet is colliding with the body of the tank. 
	  The camera will be locked onto the turret so when the turret is rotating, the camera follows. 
	  As for the controls, the tank does not turn directions, it will only rotate on the same spot when left of right inputs are given. 
	  And the rotation of the tank and the turret is separate just as other First Person Shooter games. 
	  If run on computers, the rotation of the turret will follow the movement input of a mouse. 
	  As an input from the left mouse button is received, the tank will shoot a bullet in a straight line, and the camera will zoom in by the input of the right mouse button. 
	  The tank is given the ability to increase the value of y-axis for its position or in simple term, fly, and while the tank is airborne, it will remain afloat since the gravity of the map is set to almost zero. 
	  The tank is also given the ability to lower its position from y-axis until the body of the tank collides with the terrain. 
	  An ammo counter will be presented at the bottom right corner and its value will decrease if a shooting input is received. 
	  A hit point counter will be presented at the bottom left corner and its value will decrease if a bullet collides with the tank body. 
	  The player can also take damage when other tanks collide with the player’s tank. 
	  As for the map, there will be objects placed on the terrain such as trees and buildings, these objects can be destroyed by bullets from tanks. 
	  There will be invisible barriers on the top of the map and the sides to limit the height and the end of the map, objects will not be able to go through these barriers.</p>
